/// HybridCustody defines a framework for sharing accounts via account linking.
/// In the contract, there are three main resources:
///
/// 1. OwnedAccount - A resource which maintains an AuthAccount Capability, and handles publishing and revoking access
///    of that account via another resource called a ChildAccount
/// 2. ChildAccount - A second resource which exists on the same account as the OwnedAccount and contains the filters
///    and retrieval patterns governing the scope of parent account access. A Capability on this resource is shared to
///    the parent account, enabling Hybrid Custody access to the underlying account.
/// 3. Manager - A resource setup by the parent which manages all child accounts shared with it. The Manager resource
///    also maintains a set of accounts that it "owns", meaning it has a capability to the full OwnedAccount resource
///    and would then also be able to manage the child account's links as it sees fit.
